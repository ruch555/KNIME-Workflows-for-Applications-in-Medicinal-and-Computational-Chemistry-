This file contains a brief description of the KNIME workflows included in the poster. 

Figure 1: KNIME workflow for data cleaning and decision tree analysis

Figure 2: KNIME workflow for data input, application of a genetic algorithm, and insertion of a linear correlation routine prior to the genetic algorithm

Figure 3: KNIME workflow taking input for variation of thresholds and data output from Figure 2 for use in a machine learning model
