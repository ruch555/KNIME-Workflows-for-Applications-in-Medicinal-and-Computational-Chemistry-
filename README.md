# KNIME-Workflows-for-Applications-in-Medicinal-and-Computational-Chemistry
This file contains a brief description of the KNIME workflows included in the manuscript. 

Figure 1. A. KNIME workflow for data cleaning (Box B), decision tree analysis, and a preliminary machine learning model, giving the output shown in Figure 4. B. Details of Box B, showing the procedure for data cleaning, including manipulation of pKa values (Box C). C. Workflow for extracting the most acidic pKa for compounds with multiple acidic groups. 

Figure 2. A. KNIME workflow for data input (Figure 1), generation of a list of features (Box B), application of a genetic algorithm (Box C), counting of the resulting features (Box D), and insertion of a linear correlation routine (Box E) prior to the genetic algorithm, giving the output shown in Figure 5. B. Details of Box B. C. Details of Box C showing the feature selection loop in the genetic algorithm. D. Details of Box D.  E. Details of Box E, showing nodes for elimination of features based on autocorrelation, with the connections to Boxes B and C.

Figure 3. KNIME workflow taking input for variation of thresholds and data output from Figure 2 for use in a machine learning model, giving the output shown in Figure 7.
